# PROJECT TITLE
Pore

## Short Description
This project constructs a generative model based on local soft tissue behavior and structural feedback mechanisms, aiming to explore the generative logic of biological forms such as shell spirals, porous topologies and flexible folds within digital systems.

## Introduction 
My inspiration originates from the spiral growth patterns of shell-bearing organisms and the flexible structural characteristics of soft tissue. By integrating Python and TouchDesigner, construct a generative model based on local soft tissue behavior and structural feedback mechanisms., aiming to simulate directional spiral growth in shells, porous topologies in cavity-like biological structures, and dynamic folds in soft tissues.

The system experiments with three types of morphological generation mechanisms. First, using Python in combination with polar coordinate equations and the Archimedean spiral, 
it simulates the spiral growth trajectories of shells to explore structural patterns of axial expansion and scale increment. Then, TouchDesigner is employed to simulate the porous distribution and spatial connectivity of shell surfaces. 
Finally, the project models the folding and feedback behavior of soft-bodied surfaces, using local deformation and self-regulating mechanisms to reveal the adaptive capacity of flexible tissues in changing environments.

You need to supply three pieces of hardware to show this project:

Display  
There are two possible display methods for this work:

* Projection onto a flat surface – A standard projector can be used to project the visuals onto a white wall or a white projection screen.
* Immersive three-panel installation – The visuals can also be presented within a three-sided projection 


*2. Computer 

The coding has been successfully run on the following models:

Apple M3 Max (16-inch, 2021)， 36GB unified memory，1TB SSD²，Mac OS Sonoma 14.8.3.
MacBook Pro 16” (Late 2019)Intel Core i7 / i9（9th Gen），36GB unified memory， 1TB SSD²
macOS (Apple Silicon – MacBook Pro M1 to M4 series)

The computer must be connected to the screen by an HDMI.

*3. Light

The audience should be placed in complete darkness to ensure the imagery is rendered with maximum clarity and contrast.
Any ambient or spill light should be eliminated from the exhibition space to preserve the intended perceptual experience.  


##Technology Used
*How did you make it, what libraries etc used*

## Installation

There are two ways to present this work:

*1. Pre-rendered playback 
   Use a pre-edited video recording of the piece for projection or display. Connect the video from the computer to the screen or projector via the HDMI interface.

*2. Live generative version  
   Install Python and configure the py5 environment.  
   The visuals are generated in real-time and streamed via NDI to a receiver such as TouchDesigner for display.

## Calibration 
* Sound synchronization
If the installation includes sound, confirm that there is no noticeable audio delay. The sound should respond to real-time events or visuals without lag.

* Visual display
Ensure that the projected or screen-displayed visuals appear correctly.  
Check for proper orientation (portrait or landscape), resolution (e.g. 1920×1080), and smooth frame playback.
//If using NDI, verify that the video stream is being received without latency or frame skipping.
