# PROJECT TITLE
Pore

## Short Description
This project constructs a generative model based on local soft tissue behavior and structural feedback mechanisms, aiming to explore the generative logic of biological forms such as shell spirals, porous topologies and flexible folds within digital systems.

## Concept / Intent

My inspiration originates from the spiral growth patterns of shell-bearing organisms and the flexible structural characteristics of soft tissue. By integrating Python and TouchDesigner, construct a generative model based on local soft tissue behavior and structural feedback mechanisms., aiming to simulate directional spiral growth in shells, porous topologies in cavity-like biological structures, and dynamic folds in soft tissues.

The system experiments with three types of morphological generation mechanisms. First, using Python in combination with polar coordinate equations and the Archimedean spiral, 
it simulates the spiral growth trajectories of shells to explore structural patterns of axial expansion and scale increment. Then, TouchDesigner is employed to simulate the porous distribution and spatial connectivity of shell surfaces. 
Finally, the project models the folding and feedback behavior of soft-bodied surfaces, using local deformation and self-regulating mechanisms to reveal the adaptive capacity 
of flexible tissues in changing environments.
