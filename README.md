# PROJECT TITLE
Pore

## Short Description
This project constructs a generative model based on local soft tissue behavior and structural feedback mechanisms, aiming to explore the generative logic of biological forms such as shell spirals, porous topologies and flexible folds within digital systems.

## Introduction 
My inspiration originates from the spiral growth patterns of shell-bearing organisms and the flexible structural characteristics of soft tissue. By integrating Python and TouchDesigner, construct a generative model based on local soft tissue behavior and structural feedback mechanisms., aiming to simulate directional spiral growth in shells, porous topologies in cavity-like biological structures, and dynamic folds in soft tissues.

The system experiments with three types of morphological generation mechanisms. First, using Python in combination with polar coordinate equations and the Archimedean spiral, 
it simulates the spiral growth trajectories of shells to explore structural patterns of axial expansion and scale increment. Then, TouchDesigner is employed to simulate the porous distribution and spatial connectivity of shell surfaces. 
Finally, the project models the folding and feedback behavior of soft-bodied surfaces, using local deformation and self-regulating mechanisms to reveal the adaptive capacity of flexible tissues in changing environments.

You need to supply three pieces of hardware to show this project:

*1. Display  
There are two possible display methods for this work:
*1.Projection onto a flat surface – A standard projector can be used to project the visuals onto a white wall or a white projection screen.
*2.Immersive three-panel installation – The visuals can also be presented within a three-sided projection
